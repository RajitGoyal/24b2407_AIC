1-Month AI Hackathon Preparation Plan

Week 1: Problem Identification & Team Formation
Objective: Define scope and assemble team

Problem Selection:

Brainstorm 3-5 domain-specific challenges (e.g., healthcare diagnostics, climate modeling).

Use design thinking workshops to finalize one problem with measurable impact metrics .

Quantitative Formulation:

Convert problem to ML task (classification/regression) with success criteria (e.g., â‰¥85% accuracy).


Week 2: Data & Infrastructure Setup
Data Pipeline:

Source datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, or APIs (Twitter, Google Trends).

Preprocess: Handle missing values, outliers, and imbalances.

Tooling:

Set up cloud GPU instances.

Version control: Initialize Git repo.


Week 3: Model Development & Validation
EDA & Baseline Models:

Create visualizations: Feature distributions, correlation matrices.

Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for performance benchmarks .

Advanced Modeling:

Experiment with architectures: Transformers for NLP, ResNet-50 for CV tasks.

Hyperparameter tuning: Use Optuna/Ray Tune for automated optimization .


Week 4: Integration & Dry Runs
End-to-End Pipeline:

Build a minimalist frontend (Streamlit/Gradio) for demo .

Conduct 2-3 mock presentations to refine pitch.
