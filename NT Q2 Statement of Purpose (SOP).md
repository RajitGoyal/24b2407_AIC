NT Q2: Statement of Purpose (SOP)

I have a strong interest in machine learning and data science, and I am eager to deepen my understanding in these fields. My primary motivation for joining the Artificial Intelligence Community (AIC) is to gain hands-on experience by working on real-world projects, which I believe offers far more valuable learning than simply completing online courses.

I have been consistently learning through various courses. I have completed the "Supervised Machine Learning: Linear Regression and Classification" course and am currently enrolled in the "Advanced Learning Algorithms" course offered by Stanford University. Additionally, I have taken a "Data Science and Analytics" course during the Summer of Science and participated in an "Algorithmic Trading" course as part of the Summer of Code. These experiences have equipped me with practical skills and theoretical knowledge in both machine learning and data science.

I am confident that I can contribute to AIC with my current knowledge and, more importantly, with my enthusiasm and passion for learning. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded peers, tackle challenging projects, and further develop my expertise. 

Joining AIC represents an excellent opportunity for me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. I am excited to learn from experienced mentors, work on impactful projects, and grow as a data science and machine learning practitioner.
